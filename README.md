# Pay-Timer

This project incorporates HTML/CSS (Bootstrap/Bootswatch) and Javascript (React/JSX) to create a dynamic timer that toggles between states and performs calculations based on user input.

App text:

We all know time slows down while you're on the clock. It's the little things that help us get by. Like figuring out how much we just got paid to make a cup of coffee, answer natures call, or simply stare into the abyss.  With this handy timer, you can figure out how much you've made with a press of a button so you can spend company time doing 'better' things.
